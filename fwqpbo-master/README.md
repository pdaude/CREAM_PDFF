ABOUT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FWQPBO is a command-line tool for MRI [chemical shift based fat-water 
separation with B0-correction based on QPBO graph cuts
](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.26479). 
Input paramaters are provided by human readable configuration files. 
See example configuration files provided with FWQPBO for details. 
Input data can be in DICOM format, or [MATLAB format according to the 
ISMRM 2012 challenge](http://challenge.ismrm.org/node/14).
FWQPBO is written in Python.

HOW TO USE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First install required packages, see dependencies.
To use the command-line tool, type 
```
./main.py -h.
```
To use as a Python script, see example file [./demo.py](demo.py). The demo
reconstructs [data from the ISMRM 2012 challenge (data download required)
](http://challenge.ismrm.org/node/4).
