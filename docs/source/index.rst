======================================


What is CREAM_PDFF ?
********************
The CREAM_PDFF is a open-source multi-language toolbox (Python & MATLAB) developed to evaluate state-of-the art open source fat-water separation algorithms for proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* quantification.
